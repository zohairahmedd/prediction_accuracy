## Calculating a Model's Accuracy, Precision, & Recall
Developed a script using Python that calculates accuracy, precision, and recall using a csv file with model predictions and another with ground truth values.
- Utilized the CSV library

## Commands
- create a virtual environment
- pip3 install python-csv
- run with "python3 (python filename) -imp (path to csv file with model predictions) -ig (path to csv file with groundtruth values)"

## Example of Running Script
- python3 APR_calculations.py -imp C:\directory\model.csv -ig C:\directory\groundtruth.csv
